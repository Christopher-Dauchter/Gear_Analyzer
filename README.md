# Gear_Analyzer
Takes in a flatbead scan of a smattering of gears, and tells you compatibility.

This project is used in conjunction with a projector mounted above the flatbead scanner, so that it can illuminate the various gears in differnt colors if they are compatible.

Below are some pictures of the projection working on the example files.
